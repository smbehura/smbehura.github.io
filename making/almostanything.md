# How to Make (Almost) Anything

I took a class called How to Make (Almost) Anything which involved doing a project every week focusing on different types of skills. The skills included various types of 2D and 3D CNC machining, using laser cutters and waterjets and different methods of construction including molding and casting and composite layups. The 14 different projects are all documented at [this website link](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Architecture/people/soma/).
