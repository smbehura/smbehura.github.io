# Spin^2

This project was designed and built for East Campus Rush. East Campus Rush refers to events and activities the dorm I lived in at MIT (East Campus) runs to attract freshmen to our dorm and help them understand the building/making culture in my dorm. Spin^2 was a ride meant to rotate 2 people around a vertical axis while at the same time rotating them around a horizontal axis flipping them upside down. The other caveat of EC rush is that it's supposed to happen all over one week. The project required a lot of welding and also a lot of safety oversight. Unfortunately in the end, the metal epoxy failed but I learned so much through this week of construction. It was probably one of the most short term and stressful projects I've ever led but the amount I learned in that short period of time was amazing. I only have a few pictures of the project because of the urgency of the project and my own forgetfulness. This was designed and safety tested in SolidWorks and using SolidWorks simulation and manufactured through welding and woodworking.
