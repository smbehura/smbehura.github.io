## introduction
Soma (Simantini Mitra-Behura) is an artist trained in Odissi classical dance as well as modern choreographic techniques. They have been learning, teaching and performing dance for over 20 years. They currently study under Padmashree Guru Aruna Mohanty at [Orissa Dance Academy](https://orissadanceacademy.org/theacademy.html).

Their practice is grounded in a deep appreciation for Odissi's storytelling capacity through both abstract and literal choreographies. Soma strives to marry this storytelling capacity with precision in movement and technique; the result is embodied narrative.

Currently based in London, UK. Read more about Soma's dance journey [here](https://somadoes.com/dance/asajourney/).

    <h3>Barsha Abhishaara Duet</h3>
    <p>
      The Indian soil dry with the prolonged heat of summer eagerly welcomes the arrival of the rains. The cooling drops of the first rain arouse myriads of sensations in the mind. It is a symbol of new life, regeneration, of the thrill and passion of romance, love and joy of living. With the distant thunder, rocks tumble down and lightning blinds the eye. The dance, Barsha Abhishaara, is a celebration of the arrival of rain and the pangs of separation that lovers suffer, yearning for the beloved.<br><br>

    <h3>Khammaj Pallavi</h3>
    <p>
      Pallavi means elaboration. It is another composition of pure dance with movements of lyrical grace. It is based on a melody (raga) which is soft, lilting and melodious. Beautiful dance passages run parallel with rhythmic syllables sung musically.<br><br>
