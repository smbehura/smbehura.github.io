## intro
Soma (Simantini Mitra-Behura) is an artist trained in Odissi classical dance as well as modern choreographic techniques. They have been learning, teaching and performing dance for over 20 years.

Their practice is grounded in a deep appreciation for Odissi's storytelling capacity through both abstract and literal choreographies. Soma strives to marry this storytelling capacity with precision in movement and technique; the result is embodied narrative.

Currently based in London, UK. Read more about Soma's dance journey [here](https://somadoes.com/dance/asajourney/).
