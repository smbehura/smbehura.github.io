beginning note:
this story has been stewing in my mind for 2.5 months (since you asked me for a story *cry*) at this point but for some reason executing it has taken so so long. it's something about identity but it isn't fully thought out yet, the world is not fleshed out and i don't have a strong beginning or end or strong, obvious themes besides identity confusion. (so basically please have no expectations) i might end up doing a series of shorts in this universe but we shall see.
