beginning note:

an unintended christmas gift. this story has been stewing in my mind for 2.5 months (since you asked me for a story *cry*) at this point but for some reason executing it has taken so so long. it's something about identity but it isn't fully thought out yet, the world is not fleshed out and i don't have a strong beginning or end or strong, obvious themes besides identity confusion. (so basically please have no expectations) i might end up doing a series of shorts in this universe but we shall see. also much of this world is unplanned and occurs as it is written. listening to arca whilst writing this.

The person gazed out the window, one arm folded behind, the other bent to grasp a glass tumbler, clear liquid swishing with slight revolutions of a hand. Box-like units, containers of various colors spread out in mismatched arrays ahead of them, colors denoting purpose, locations optimized on shortest distances to accomplish societal tasks. This specific array of components was highly optimized. Few other people could be seen traversing pathways forking between units as the schedule denoted primarily in-unit interactions presently. They themselves were not meant to be idling in front of a window but such idling was well within their limits of time diversity. Few others were likely to so haphazardly use their time diversity in this array.

That's why it came as a shock when a flash of movement, darkness entered their line of sight, completely disregarding typical pathways and timelines. They watched with awe and confusing horror as the flash of human leapt on top of a unit (units cannot withstand that weight!). Only a very select number of people were graced with the luck of genes and conditioning to accomplish such a jump. Riveted, they watched as the flash paused at the top corner of the unit (begrudgingly the most structurally sound portion), glancing back quickly allowing them their first glimpse of a face under a black hood, all angles. Something outside the window's boundaries alarmed the flash. The flash lithely jumped down, out of sight between components. The person scrambled forward, pressing one hand against the glass (or bars?), the other clutching the tumbler of sloshing liquid, peering around the edges of the window (what was chasing the flash!?). Nothing obvious could be detected, perhaps a shimmer in the air?

In their frantic search for a pursuer, they almost missed a glint of purple in the middle of their line of sight. Focusing, they realized this purple appeared only two units beyond where the flash dropped, disappeared. Searching the purple glint's face, they were surprised to find a glimmer of recognition. Angles softened, perhaps a slightly wider nose but the similar symmetries could not be dismissed. More than the static physical, this glint's mannerisms were equivalent. Furtive glances then a transformation into one of the many, traversing the pathways, steps nimble and smooth.

They had witnessed examples of such transformations, novelty performances from those specialized in genetic and musculoskeletal control but these performances took at least an hour, pain apparent on the artist's face throughout the ordeal. The flash, the glint must have undergone an extraordinary amount of pain to accomplish such a feat so quickly. Or they could be wrong. The flash wasn't the glint? Impossible. They had always been especially perceptive in reading similarities in movement, it's why actors in movies were still unconvincing. Those who did transform so completely such that even they could not recognize the actor in previous works often lost their mind or developed disorders, realities enmeshed and unrooted. Their minds lived in no constant reality. The flash-glint must be the same person unless such similar agility was present in two individuals in this close proximity. Nearly impossible.

A tap on the shoulder dragged them out of their reverie. Wildly, they flipped their head around. Recognition filtered through, colleague, unchanged. Calm. Only then did they consider the time diversity they might have taken. Their colleague slightly wrinkled their forehead, concerned. They just shook their head with a slight smile, short curls bouncing (or was it straight locks swishing?), downed the drink and pushed off the window. The colleague smoothed their creases of doubt, shy smile, and reported, "We're gathering for a meeting, 1 hour."

"Who are you?"

"What can that mean?"
