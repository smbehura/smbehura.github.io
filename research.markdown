I am a prospective PhD student interested in computational materials science methods that use machine learning to accelerate materials discovery and design.

I have a background in materials science and engineering and mathematics and have built Python-based Abaqus pipelines simulating MEMS devices and folded kirigami to visualize energy absorption across thickness, curvature, and fold angles. Currently, I am the lead data scientist at [Girl Effect](https://girleffect.org/) developing generative AI–driven agentic systems.

I am interested in applying existing models to new material systems and designing new materials models whose architectures better represent physical material structures and incorporate stronger physics-based constraints for energy, electronics, and other sustainable technologies.
