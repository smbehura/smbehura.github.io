DETAILED JOURNEY WILL BE HERE
I am a London-based performer with 20 years of experience in Odissi. My training began in 2003 at age 5 under Guru Supradipta Datta in Houston, TX. Early on, I performed in solo and group productions at renowned festivals including Houston Diwali Festival held in the prestigious Wortham Centre and International Odissi Festival 2013 in Bhubaneswar, Odisha where I was the youngest solo performer.

While Guru Supradipta Datta built my foundations, I was lucky enough to have other gurus in Odisha including Gurus Aloka Kanungo, Manoranjan Pradhan, and Sujata Mahapatra. In particular, I began training under Padmashree Awardee Guru Aruna Mohanty with Orissa Dance Academy from 2015. Since 2017, she has been my main guru.
With Guru Aruna Mohanty, I have had the privilege of extending my body’s capability for diverse movement and abhinaya. Under her tutelage, I have performed solo several times in Boston, London, Odisha, and Assam. I also had the honor of performing and scriptwriting for her production of Saptavarna that toured the US in 2019, spanning several cities in Texas, California, Florida, and DC.

In university, I attended multiple choreography classes: ‘Choreography’ with Professor Dan Safer at MIT and ‘Choreographies of Resistance’ with Professor Sharon Kivenko at Harvard. These classes broadened my concept of choreography beyond what I observed under Guru Aruna Mohanty and gave me new techniques to develop my choreographic practice. With old and new techniques, I have had the opportunity to develop experimental pieces for academic, public, and personal showcase since 2018.
