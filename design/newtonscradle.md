I created this item for my high school physics teacher as a gift. I wasn't expecting it to actually function very well as a Newton's cradle because I did not think the momentum would transfer well through plastic and was surprised by how well the motion carried for at least a little bit (as can be seen in video below). I designed this with Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed it using Shapeways.
