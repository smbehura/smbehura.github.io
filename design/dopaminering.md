# Dopamine Ring

I made this ring for a best friend's birthday. She loves organic chemistry and her name begins with the letter N so i tried to combine those with a dopamine molecule and the letter N. It took a couple tries to project the sketch correctly on to the cylindrical surface but it was less of a challenge because at this point I had designed a number of things in this fashion. One regret I had in this project was the fact that I made some of the points a little too sharp and accidentally did not fillet all the edges. My friend reported sometimes accidentally scratching her finger when trying to take the ring off. I used Autodesk Inventor to design and Shapeways to 3D print in metal.
