# Wolf Cube

This paperweight was created again for a close friend's birthday but was paid for by a large number of people. This friend did not wear any jewelry and I was not aware of any problems in her life that could be solved with 3D printing so I designed a sort of memento for her instead. The interesting parts of this design for me was the rotating medallion inside the cube. I wasn't sure if I had enough tolerance and was also worried I had made the connections too thin to last for more than 5 minutes. I was lucky to find that after 3D printing, the medallion spun well and did not break off its fixtures. I designed this in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed using Shapeways again.
