# Album CD Case

I made this cover for a dear friend of mine who enjoyed making music. I thought it would be a relatively easy project but ended up being very very wrong because the I underestimated how difficult it would be to work with the art on the cover of the album. I learned a great deal about how to work with images and specifically turn these images into sketches effectively in this project. It was also the second project that I tested moving part capabilities with 3D printing. The album case opened and closed as desired and I was glad to find the tolerances I used were effective. I used Autodesk Inventor to design the cover and Shapeways to print the final piece.
