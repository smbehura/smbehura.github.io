I made this object as a going away gift for my dance teacher who is like a second mom. It was definitely one of my most time-consuming projects and took about 24 hours to fully design. Jagannath is the main religious figure in my classical Indian dance form (Odissi) so this gift was a tribute to him and to my dance teacher. The dance figures in the background actually came from pictures of me that I turned into sketches and extruded. The dance figures were supposed to be able to turn and twist but this time my tolerances were off and I first of all did not give the supports enough material to be structural so on the first attempt they break and second did not give nearly enough tolerance for the dance figures to actually move freely. Attached is a picture of the broken piece. I eventually 3D printed a version that wasn't broken but unfortunately do not currently have a picture. I designed this in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed it using Shapeways.
