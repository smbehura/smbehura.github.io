# Modeling a Particle on a Mobius Strip

For my class Computational Methods for Materials Science (3.016), I modeled the probability function of a particle on a mobius strip. This involved solving Schrodinger's equations for an interesting set of boundary conditions described somewhat by the following picture.

Applying these boundary conditions in which one rotation led to the negative of the original starting point created interesting probability distributions (as seen below). I have a notebook dedicated to explaining this simulation better which can PERHAPS be acquired by contacting me (somamb19@gmail.com).
