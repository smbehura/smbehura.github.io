# Simulating a MEMS Actuator

I designed this for my research project under Prashant Patil in the Center for Bits and Atoms. It's a MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) actuator that would eventually be able to manipulate microscale objects that clicked together like LEGO's. I performed several analyses on these including analyses on the spring flexures using SolidWorks force simulations and COMSOL Multiphysics to model the effects of the electrostatics on the structure of the device. The device was designed in SolidWorks and tested in SolidWorks and COMSOL. My graduate student advisor eventually created the device using deposition and spinning techniques. Attached are images of the analyses I did for the actuator springs.
